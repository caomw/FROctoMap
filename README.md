Frequency Map Enhancement
======

Abstract:

The method allows for efficient volumetric representation of dynamic three-dimensional environments over long periods of time.
It's based on combination of a well-established 3D mapping framework called Octomaps [1] and an idea to model environment dynamics by its frequency spectrum [2].
The proposed method allows not only for efficient representation, but also reliable prediction of the future states of dynamic three-dimensional environments.
This repository contains the spatio-temporal mapping framework intended for ROS.
